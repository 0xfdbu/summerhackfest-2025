### 3. User Experience (20 points)

**Evaluates:** Design quality, usability, accessibility, and overall user journey

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **16-20** | Exceptional UX/UI design, intuitive interface, excellent accessibility, smooth user journey, mobile-responsive |
| **12-15** | Good design and usability, mostly intuitive, some accessibility features, decent user journey |
| **8-11** | Acceptable design, basic usability, minimal accessibility, functional user journey |
| **4-7** | Poor design, confusing interface, no accessibility considerations, difficult user journey |
| **0-3** | Unusable interface, broken user experience, no design consideration |

**UX Evaluation Factors:**
- Interface design and visual appeal
- Navigation and information architecture
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance)
- Mobile responsiveness

- Onboarding and user guidance

### 4. Innovation (20 points)

**Evaluates:** Creativity, originality, problem-solving approach, and potential impact

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **16-20** | Highly innovative concept, novel approach to problem-solving, significant potential impact, creative use of technology |
| **12-15** | Good innovation, interesting approach, moderate potential impact, some creative elements |
| **8-11** | Some innovative aspects, standard approach with minor twists, limited impact potential |
| **4-7** | Minimal innovation, mostly standard implementation, very limited impact |
| **0-3** | No innovation, copy of existing solutions, no clear impact |

**Innovation Considerations:**
- Novelty of the concept or approach
- Creative problem-solving
- Potential market impact
- Technical innovation
- Business model innovation
- Social or environmental impact

### 5. Presentation (10 points)

**Evaluates:** Demo quality, communication effectiveness, and pitch delivery
