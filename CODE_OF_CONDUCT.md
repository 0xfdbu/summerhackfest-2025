# Conflux Hackathons Code of Conduct

The Conflux Hackathons Series is a community-driven initiative intended for collaboration and learning in the Conflux ecosystem. We value the participation of each member of the Conflux community and aspire that all attendees have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience.

The overarching goal of our hackathons is to foster developer engagement with the Conflux blockchain network (the "**Network**") resulting in the deployment and launch of high-quality and durable projects on the Network. The secondary goal is to foster the growth of the Network's global developer community while embodying Conflux's values of innovation, inclusivity, and technical excellence through tangible action and competitive events that involve participants from the entire ecosystem.

Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the hackathon. To make clear what is expected, all attendees, contributors, sponsors, speakers, mentors, and other participants at this hackathon are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct and agree to be bound by the [Hackathon Terms and Conditions](./docs/terms-and-conditions.md).

The Conflux Foundation will enforce this code throughout the event.

## The Code

Harassment includes but is not limited to offensive verbal comments, hacks, or other online activity related to gender, sexual orientation, physical or mental ability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, physical appearance, race, religion, sexual images, deliberate intimidation, stalking, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. Failure to comply will result in disqualification from the hackathon and removal from all hackathon events and related activities.

Be careful and mindful of the words that you choose. If a participant engages in behavior that violates this code of conduct, the Conflux Foundation will take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the hackathon.

If you feel uncomfortable or think there may be a potential violation of the code of conduct, please report it immediately to one of the event organizers or contact us through our Discord or Telegram channels. All reporters have the right to remain anonymous.

## Contest Eligibility

- To participate in the hackathon, the project must be deployed on the Conflux Network's mainnet, testnet, or devnet, or otherwise integrated with the Network.
- Participating projects must be either a new project on the Network, or an established project that's implementing a well-defined new feature or redesign within the hackathon duration.
  - For the avoidance of doubt, features implemented before the hackathon registration period will not be eligible for participation in the contest.
- Team must be able to participate in the contest and be online during the corresponding demo day.
- A member of the project team must pass KYC to receive any awards in connection with the hackathon.
- Applications for the hackathon must include the following information:
  - Project name and logo
  - Project website (if applicable)
  - Primary contact
  - GitHub repository
  - Project description
  - App store link (if applicable)
  - If the project is an existing project on the Network, please briefly describe the new feature or redesign that will be completed during the hackathon.

## Rules on Pre-existing Work

- We do not allow participants to submit pre-existing projects - you may start working on your project once the hackathon officially begins.
- You should not be working on your project before the hackathon officially begins. This includes coding, designing assets, etc. Each hackathon submission will be judged solely on the quality of the work completed during the duration of the hackathon.
- We require everyone starts building from scratch - if there is a situation where a project/team are porting or continuing existing projects, you may request explicit permission from Conflux Foundation in writing before continuing to work on or submit the project.
- You may use any pre-existing code in your project only after you have notified Conflux Foundation in writing about the nature of previously done work and have gotten approval. Further, you need to disclose all relevant information in your submission video, project description, and during judging clarifying what specifically was done before the hackathon.
- If, upon inspection (during or after the event), you present work that appears to have been completed before the hackathon, or does not accurately reflect your project description/video, or extends existing work that was not disclosed, your project is subject to immediate disqualification with full revocation of any prize amounts along with a permanent ban from Conflux Foundation community and events.
- By using any pre-existing work (even after written approval), you forfeit the right to be considered as a finalist for the hackathon.
- In order to ensure that no pre-existing work makes its way into the submission, you must also use version control for your code throughout the course of the event. Any repositories with single commits of large files without proper history will be default assumed to be unqualified unless proven otherwise.
